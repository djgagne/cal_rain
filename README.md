### Setup

To prepare your local machine to process the data for this competition, first install the Miniconda Python distribution [here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). Then install the required dependencies for the contest using the following command line command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate ramp
```

Install [ramp-workflow](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow), then execute the following line
```bash
ramp_test_submission
```
to make sure the starting kit submission works. Once you create your own submission, you can test it using the same command.
